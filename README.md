# First Express Lab
**[](#getting-started)Getting Started**

In the `homework` directory for today, create a Javascript file `server.js`. Write your answers inside this one js file.

*   `npm init -y`. You should receive a `package.json`.

Install express. `npm i express`. Check your files.

:elephant: _Hint_: You can check to make sure your installation was successful in one of the following places:

*   Your `package.json` file should have `express` listed in the dependencies.
*   You could also check in your `node_modules` folder to see an`express` folder.
*   Require `express` and set the `app`. (look back to the markdown from today if you need more help on how to do this).
*   Tell the server where to listen for requests (the port).

[](#greetings)Greetings
-----------------------

2.  Make a route `'/greeting'` that sends a generic greeting to the screen like "Hello, stranger".
3.  Give the `greeting` route a param `/:name`
4.  When hitting the route, the page should display a message such as "Hello, ", or "What's up, `<name>`", or "`<name>`! It's so great to see you!" (ex. hitting `'/greeting/Jimmy-boy'` should display `Wow! Hello there, Jimmy-boy` on the page).

"Greeting express application created."

[](#tip-calculator)Tip Calculator
---------------------------------

1.  Your app should have a route of `'/tip'` and it should expect _2 params_. One should be `total` and one should be `tipPercentage`.
2.  When hitting the route, the page should _display how much your tip will be_ based on the total amount of the bill and the tip percentage. (ex. hitting `'/tip/100/20'` should display `20` on the page).

[](#magic-8-ball)Magic 8 Ball
-----------------------------

1.  Create a route of `'/magic'` that should expect a phrase in the URL that ask the Magic 8 ball a question.
2.  So if the user hits that route and asks a question of "Will I be a Millionaire" (ex. `'/magic/Will%20I%20Be%20A%20Millionaire'`) he should have return to him his question AND a random Magic 8 ball response (see the array below) on the screen.
3.  We can't use spaces in the url, so we use `%20` to express a space in the url.
4.  So if the user hits that route and asks a question of "Will I be a Millionaire" he should get his question asked and a random Magic 8 ball quote on the screen.
5.  Send the magic 8 ball response back between html `<h1>` tags
6.  Use this array of Magic 8 ball responses.....
`["It is certain", "It is decidedly so", "Without a doubt", "Yes definitely","You may rely on it", "As I see it yes", "Most likely", "Outlook good","Yes", "Signs point to yes", "Reply hazy try again", "Ask again later","Better not tell you now", "Cannot predict now", "Concentrate and ask again","Don't count on it", "My reply is no", "My sources say no","Outlook not so good", "Very doubtful"]`
